This mobileapp purpose is to manage individually all status from each customer (weights, routines, account status, records, etc), also it will contain UGYM's next events and information discloseable to public (news, schedules, etc).

The webapp modules will be managed by administration at UGYM (owner, receptionist, trainers): Users, roles, hierarhies, events, customers, reports, etc.
